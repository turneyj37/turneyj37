- 👋 Hi, I’m @turneyj37
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematical analyses of everyday phenomena to measure uncertainties of day-to-day life - be that through video games, consumer data, polls, etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to analyze data using models and linear regression methods.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects pertaining to human behaviour as they analyze decision making processes.
